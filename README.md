This is a first try to:
=======================

1. manage an egit project within eclipse. 
2. use spring-tests for testing controlers  
3. use backbone.js as a javascript MV* Container along with underscore.js and prototype for templating
4. use QUnit.js for javascript continuous testing (see) qunitTest.html
5. use Ember as a javascript MV* Container  along with  Handlebars for templating

Have fun
